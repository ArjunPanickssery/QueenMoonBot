# DiscordWtfBot

The most pointless Discord bot ever

## Add it to your server:
  https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=684867671552294994&scope=bot&permissions=8




## To run on your own server
make a file named `config.json` in the root directory of the repo. Head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and get a token for a new bot. Place that token in `config.json` in the following format:

```
{
  "token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```
